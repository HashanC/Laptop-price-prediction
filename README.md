# Laptop-price-predictor
This project mainly consists of web application that integrated by a machine learning model which will be able 
to make a prediction of laptopsâ€™ prices based on their key features(Brand, ram, PPI, Typename etc).
Web application will facilitate people in choosing the components they need , and they could obtain an idea about what will be the expected 
price of the laptop they want.

## Steps of building machine learning model(Regression model)
1. Data preprocessing.
2. EDA & feature engineering.
3. Algorithm selection.
4. Training
5. Evaluation.
6. Parameter tuning
7. Deployment

## Web UI
